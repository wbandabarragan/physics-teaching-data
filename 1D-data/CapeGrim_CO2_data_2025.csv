This file contains the monthly mean baseline (background) carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration
"measured at the Kennaook / Cape Grim Baseline Air Pollution Station (KCGBAPS), "
"located near the north-west tip of Tasmania, Australia."
"KCGBAPS is funded and managed by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, and"
the scientific program is jointly supervised with CSIRO Oceans & Atmosphere.
Please acknowledge these two institutions if these data are used in publications or presentations.

For more information on Kennaook / Cape Grim please see:

The CO2 units are parts per million in dry air (ppm).

The most recent year of data is provided in this file on
a provisional basis only. These data may be subject to further revision. 
CSIRO & the Bureau make every effort to produce the most accurate and 
"precise measurements possible. However, they reserve the right to make"
corrections to the data based on recalibration of standard gases
or for other reasons deemed scientifically justified.
