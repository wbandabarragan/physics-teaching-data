BHDCGO_MONTHLY_SMOOTH_CURVE produced 2021-01-22,,,,,,,,
This dataset is developed as a collaboration between GNS Science and NIWA.,,,,,,,,

"ccgvu (Thoning et al., 1989) used to fit a combined BHD/CGO record in which BHD FINAL SCREENED DATA is used for all periods except 1995-2005 which has been replaced with CGO data (Levin et al., 2010)",,,,,,,,
curve fits have been interpolated from the raw measurements to provide monthly resolution,,,,,,,,
"D14C = DELTA14C, decay corrected to the date of collection, normalised to delta13C of -25 permil",,,,,,,,
"F14C = fraction modern, normalised to delta13C of -25 permil without decay correction",,,,,,,,
trend is the deseasonalised trend derived using the full Wellington 14CO2 dataset,,,,,,,,
"fit is the curve fitted to the data, performed in five separate increments (1954-1965, 1966-1979,1980-1989,1990-2004,2005-2015) to allow the seasonal cycle to vary through time",,,,,,,,
the sections have been spliced together by interpolating across two year periods,,,,,,,,
errors for trend and fit were determined from a Monte Carlo simulation of the curve fits using the assigned measurement uncertainties for each data point 1000 iterations were used,,,,,,,,
this dataset is a combination of the Wellington 14CO2 record and the Cape Grim 14CO2 record with Wellington 1995-2005 removed,,,,,,,,
